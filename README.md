## Evaluating Fast Style Transfer

After watching Gene Kogan's PyData London 2017 [talk](https://youtu.be/JXx2MYtAU3o) I thought I'd try out some of these style transfer networks. 
Searching around a bit, I found Gene's [fast-style-transfer](https://github.com/genekogan/fast-style-transfer) Github page which provides really easy setup and run instructions. I got this running with minimal effort and thought I'd post the results here. 

These are what the final images looked like
